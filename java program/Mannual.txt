                          Manual Testing
                         
mannual testing is the process of mannual testing software for defect it 
requirs a tester to play the role of an and user.When by they use most of
the applications features to ensure correct behaviers.

                     Type of Application

There are three type of application ___________
1  Native Application
2  Web application
3  Hybrid application

[1]  Native application

     Native application are those that were design to run on a particulars 
     operating system or in other word we can say the application which can
     be installed on our desktop or mobile.

[2]  Web application_____
     
     It is application  software that's run on a web server. unlike computer
     based software program that  are run locally on the operating system of
     the device.

[3] Hybrid aplication_____
    
    The hybrid application are those the natative and web application comes
    under the hybrid application.



                     Testing Principal

1.  Testing show presence of defect.
2.  Complete testing is not possible.
3.  Early testing.
4.  Defect Clustring.
5.  Pesticide Parodox.
6.  Testing is context dependent.
7.  Absence of error fallcy.


[1] Testing show presence of defect__
     
    Testing talks about the present of defect and  don't talk about the absence of 
    defect.
    It's means software product 90% of bugg free.

    Testing on application can reveal that are more defect exist in the aplication
    there for it in important to desinge test cases which find as a many defect as 
    apossible.

[2] Complete testing is not possible____

    It is not possible to test all possible combination of data and scenaros.

    100% testing is not possible  because when a testing will be done for all
    condition of application then here is spent of more time an also more.

[3] Early Testing_____
    
    Early testing should start as a early as a possible in the software development
    live cycle.
    
    If any defect in requirment are captured in early stage and it is fixed early
    stage of testing.

[4] Defect Clustring____
   
    In  this testing 80% of the problem are found in 20% of modules.
    A small number of modules contains most of defect discovery during free reliese testing.

[5] Pesticide parodox_____
   
    If the same test are  repeated over and over again evendually distest no  longer find any 
    new defect.
    
    To defect new defect adjusting test and test data may need  changing and new test  may need 
    to be defect.
 
[6] Testing is context dependent______

    Testing is the differently in  defect context ___
    For example___ medical software is tested defferently from and is commerce software.
    
    A apporch to test an application would be different for two diffrent application.

[7] Absence of error fallcy ____
   
   All type of testing is done for all specified requirment an fixing all defect found 
   could steel product a system that is  diffecult to use that means does not fullfill
   the users needs an expentation.
